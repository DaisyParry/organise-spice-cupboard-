## :beginner: Introduction: The Turing Safe Haven

Welcome to the Turing Safe Haven tool. 

Safe havnes are secure environments used for analysis of sensitive datasets and are essential for research, giving data providers confidence that their datasets will be kept secure over the course of a project. *Before* the project can get started using a safe haven, you’ll need to have classified the data you’re using to understand its sensitivity, and how it should be handled - more on this later on.

The classification should be done for each work package (the combination of all linked data you’ll be handling over the project) at ingress and egress from your safe haven environment. There are 5 tiers, ranging from open data at Tier 0, to highly sensitive and high risk data at Tier 4.
